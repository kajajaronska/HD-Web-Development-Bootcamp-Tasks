// SCENARIO 1

create array "vowels" storing all possible vowels
create empty array called "userInput" to store user's input
create variable "vowelsNum" with a value of 0 to store the final output

request the user to enter random letter
    check the type of input
        if the input is a letter
            add the input to the "userInput" array
        if the input is a number proceed to print the final output of "vowelsNum"
            loop through "userInput" to check each element against "vowels" array
                if element exists in the "vowels" array
                    increase "vowelsNum" by 1
                if element does not exist in the "vowels" array 
                    proceed to the next element
output "vowelsNum" to show total number of vowels entered by the user


// SCENARIO 2

create an array "numbersArr" storing all numbers

create "evenTotal" variable with initial value of 0 to store total sum of even numbers
create "oddTotal" variable with initial value of 0 to store total sum of odd numbers
create "evenQuantity" variable with initial value of 0 to store number of even numbers
create "oddQuantity" variable with initial value of 0 to store number of odd numbers

loop through "numbersArr" to find integers and to determine whether number is odd or even
    if number is an integer
        check if number is even
            add number to "evenTotal" variable
            increase "evenQuantity" by 1
        check if number is odd (not even)
            add number to "oddTotal" variable
            increase "oddQuantity" by 1
    if number is not an integer
        skip to the next number

divide "evenTotal" by "evenQuantity" and print the average of all even numbers
divide "oddTotal" by "oddQuantity" and print the average of all odd numbers


// SCENARIO 3

create an array "listOfNames" storing all names
sort the array in alphabetical order by comparing first letters of each name
print out each element from the "listOfNames" variable
